# Enhancing Sarcasm Detection in Social Media: A Feature Fusion Multi-Task Learning Approach Utilizing Emotion and Personality Traits

### Oct 23, 2024

I developed a feature-fusion multi-task learning model for sarcasm detection that combines textual patterns, emotions, and personality traits to improve generalization beyond hand-crafted features. The dataset used was the **SARC dataset (dataset of 1.3 million Reddit comments)**. Independent task-specific models extract representations that are fused and classified using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. The results show that integrating emotional and personality context significantly improves sarcasm detection, with Random Forest providing the most robust performance.
