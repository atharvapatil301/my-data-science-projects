# Genetic Algorithm-Driven Feature Selection for Skin Cancer Classification
### May 14, 2024


### Abstract 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising perfor-mance in automating the feature selection process for classification of images, yet achieving optimal performance remains a complex task. This paper proposes an evolutionary approach to optimize the feature selection classification of skin cancer (benign versus malignant). By using the pre-trained VGG-16 model to extract image features and then employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + Genetic Algo-rithm (GA) for feature selection, followed by a classifier to monitor accuracy, this methodology aims to yield a greater classification accuracy on minimum number of features. Artificial neural network and random forest classifier were employed for classification. Accuracy of the classifiers was observed on both, i.e., features opti-mized with only PCA and features optimized with GA-driven PCA. Results of the artificial neural network classifier are compared with that of the ensemble classifier (random forest).
